textview - when has force ltr(layou direction) and gravity end, and you set text in rtl language the text goes to start, you need to set gravity right which ignores language direction

scrollview - scroll jumps when it has a child that can focus but with space on top, clicking on child will auto scroll. textView.post { textView.requestFocus(); scrollView.scrollY = 0 }
